                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>My name is Calvin Post. I grew up West Michigan (Grand Rapids and surrounding areas), but I currently
                    reside
                    in Muncie, Indiana. I enjoy playing video games, card games, and board games.</p>
                <br>
                <p>I started off in coding when I was pretty young. In fact, HTML was my first language, which I learned
                    by
                    dissecting the code and learning how the elements and attributes affect the layout of the page. I am
                    always
                    fascinated by how things work, especially when it comes to programming.</p>
