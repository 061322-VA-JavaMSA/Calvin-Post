    <h2>Two Truths and a Lie</h2>
    <p>Here I have listed three sentences about myself, but one of them is a lie! Can you guess which one is the
        lie?</p>
        <ul>
            <li class="lie">I have never broken any bones.</li>
            <li class="truth">I have two dogs and two cats.</li>
            <li class="truth">I have every Nintendo console that has come out since the GameCube.</li>
        </ul>
